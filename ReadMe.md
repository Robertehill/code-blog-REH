Jesse Thach and I did some pair programing to get the basic stuff working.
Used info posted in slack(stackoverflow) for the date function and sorting of array.
Attached functions to blog{}; to get them out of global scope per suggestions in class.
Natalie helped with truncateArticles a little.
used code from Natalie for reference on the filtering function and from stackoverflow.
Jesse helped me to understand and use handlebars.
Natalie helped me understand the Ajax requests for the template.
